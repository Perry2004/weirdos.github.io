I have witnessed many students were progressed through our program and I am really proud of each one of them for their achievements and successes after they went to the universities for their further studies. Also, I am happy to be a part of their memories and they got the skills out of our GAC curriculums.
At this moment, we have more students and challenges and just like them I want to improve myself as a teacher and a person. My mentality is learning everyday like my students are doing the same. I don’t treat them as children and do treat them as individuals who have unlimited potential.
