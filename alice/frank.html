            GAC is not simply a high school program that teaches knowledge. Our students have the opportunity to be immersed in an environment that will train them to become a better version of themselves. They learn useful skills that will allow them to not only study more effectively, but to actually fully enjoy their university experience. We see proof of this every year when our graduates return for vacation, telling us how much easier school is for them, and how much they have been able to accomplish in their studies, as well as life, as a result of completing this program.

Many Chinese students are accepted to western universities every year, some even get into top 20 schools, but I truly believe that our students here at the GAC center are the most well prepared of all of them.
